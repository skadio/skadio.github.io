Hi! My name is Serdar. I am the Vice President of Artificial Intelligence at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelitylabs.com/) and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the [Dept. of Computer Science](http://cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University. Previously, I led the [Advanced Constraint Technology R&D](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/) team at Oracle and worked at Adobe.

My [algorithmic research](https://skadio.github.io/publications/) is at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Discrete Optimization, while my [practical interests](https://skadio.github.io/software/) are in building robust, scalable, data-driven products that address business-critical problems. 

In parallel with my industry role, I serve in the (senior) [programme committee](https://skadio.github.io/service/) of AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, and similar research organizations. [Teaching](https://skadio.github.io/teaching/) and learning from students are integral parts of my work, see, e.g., [course evaluations](https://github.com/skadio/skadio.github.io/blob/master/files/Student_Evaluations.pdf). 

## Background

### @Fidelity

Leading a team responsible for Personalization, Recommender Systems, and Marketing Campaigns from ideation to productionization across i) digital channels for customers over the web, mobile, email, and virtual agents, and ii) distribution channels for associates over the regional centers and branches. 

Internally, I help guide the research agenda of the AI Center, serve as a liaison between data science, engineering and business teams and scale out the efforts on model governance, interpretability, fairness, and bias mitigation for the enterprise. 

Externally, I coordinate strategic partnerships witin industry (Google, NVIDIA, Amazon, etc.) and universities (MIT, CMU, Northeastern, etc.),  
lead Fidelity open source projects ([MABWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser), [TextWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/textwiser), [Jurity](https://github.com/fidelity/jurity), [Seq2Pat](https://github.com/fidelity/seq2pat), etc.), help create recruiting programs and mentor students, especially those from underrepresented groups, through internships and co-op opportunities.

Here is a recent talk that covers some of our open-source work [Building Recommender Systems: A Case Study with Open Source Software](https://2021.allthingsopen.org/sessions/building-recommender-systems-a-case-study-with-open-source-software/) [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54d_YUalvOA)

### @Oracle

I led the Advanced Constraint Technology R&D team to deploy state-of-the-art optimization solutions for Oracle products facing industry-scale problems in [Supply Chain & Logistics](https://www.oracle.com/scm/), [Planning](https://www.oracle.com/erp/) & [Scheduling](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/), [Cloud Management](https://www.oracle.com/java/coherence/), and [Product Configuration](https://www.oracle.com/cx/). 

Our contributions at Oracle were recognized with an Entrepreneurship Award, funding for Oracle-CMU research collaboration, and covered in the media by [Business Insider as Oracle Rockstars](https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-rock-star-engineers-2016-3?op=0#serdar-kadioglu-turning-theory-into-products-21).

### @Adobe

I built a context-free grammar-based evolutionary algorithm to generate automated test cases for the [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) virtual machine. This [automated fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) helped discover critical software vulnerabilities that were later on fixed before any global exploits.

### @Brown

I received my Ph.D. in CS from Brown under the supervision of [Prof. Meinolf Sellmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meinolf_Sellmann). My [doctorate thesis](http://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/phd/2012/kadioglu.pdf) explored deterministic inference methods for constraint satisfaction, search protocols for constrained optimization, and stochastic local search. During my studies, I also had the chance to work at the [Combinatorial Optimization Group](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/astra) in Sweden as a visiting researcher hosted by [Prof. Pierre Flener](http://user.it.uu.se/~pierref/).

My research work was awarded the [IBM PhD Scholarship](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/awards/phdfellowship.shtml), and I was a recipient of the [Paris Kanellakis Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Kanellakis). In addition, our group at Brown designed automated algorithm configurators that won several gold medals in the [International SAT Solver Competitions](http://www.satcompetition.org/). 

I founded the [Sport Czar@Brown](http://cs.brown.edu/degrees/misc/jobs/jobs.html#sport) and was the captain of ByteSoccer, the department's soccer team with back-to-back intramural championships. I continue to serve the Brown community as an alumni interviewer for undergraduate university admissions. 

### @Sabanci

I received my B.Sc. in CS from [Sabanci](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) with the generous support of the [Sakip Sabanci Merit Scholarship](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/scholarship-opportunities-offered-during-education-period). As an Erasmus exchange student, I also studied in [Uppsala](https://www.it.uu.se/research/computing_science). I continue to serve the Sabanci community as an external committee member and through [Crossing Paths](https://www.kesisenyollar.org/), a non-profit organization to reduce inequality of opportunity in education. 

### @Soccer

Outside of work, I am an avid soccer fan; playing, watching, and [coaching youth soccer](https://www.sportsmanager.us/readingyouthsoccer.htm). In a parallel universe, I hope to be the professor of assists.
