Hi! My name is Serdar; a computer scientist who currently serves as the Vice President of Artificial Intelligence at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelitylabs.com/) and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University. Previously, I led the [Advanced Constraint Technology R&D](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/) team at Oracle and worked at Adobe.

My algorithmic research is at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Discrete Optimization, while my practical interests are in building robust, scalable, data-driven products that address business-critical problems. See [publications](https://skadio.github.io/publications/) and [software](https://skadio.github.io/software/).

[Teaching](https://skadio.github.io/teaching/) and learning from students are integral parts of my work, see, e.g., [course evaluations](https://github.com/skadio/skadio.github.io/blob/master/files/Student_Evaluations.pdf), and I frequently participate at the [programme committee](https://skadio.github.io/service/)of IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI among other research organizations.

## Background

### @Fidelity

Leading a team responsible of Personalization & Recommender Systems from ideation to productionization across Digital channels for customers over the web, mobile, and email as well as Distribution channels for associates over the regional centers and branches. More broadly, at an organizational level, I guide research publications for the AI Center of Excellence, lead open source projects for the firm (e.g., [MABWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser), [TextWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/textwiser), [Seq2Pat](https://github.com/fidelity/seq2pat)), organize company-wide Kaggle style machine learning competitions, help create an AI/ML focused college recruiting program and support students especially those from underrepresented groups through internships and co-ops.

### @Oracle

Led the Advanced Constraint Technology R&D team to ship state-of-the-art optimization solutions for Oracle products facing industry-scale resource allocation problems in [Supply Chain & Logistics](https://www.oracle.com/scm/), [Planning](https://www.oracle.com/erp/) & [Scheduling](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/), [Cloud Management](https://www.oracle.com/java/coherence/) and [Product Configuration](https://www.oracle.com/cx/). These contributions were recognized with an Oracle Entrepreneurship Award, received research funding for Oracle-CMU collaboration, and covered in the media by [Business Insider as Oracle Rockstars](https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-rock-star-engineers-2016-3?op=0#serdar-kadioglu-turning-theory-into-products-21).

### @Adobe

I built a context-free grammar based test case generator for the [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) virtual machine. This [automated fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) helped discover critical software vulnerabilities. 

### @Brown

I received my Ph.D. in CS from Brown under the supervision of [Prof. Meinolf Sellmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meinolf_Sellmann). My [doctorate thesis](http://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/phd/2012/kadioglu.pdf)  explored deterministic inference methods for constraint satisfaction, search protocols for constrained optimization, and stochastic local search. My research work was awarded the [2011 PhD Scholarship by IBM](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/awards/phdfellowship.shtml), was partially funded by the [Paris Kanellakis Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Kanellakis), and won several gold medals in the [International SAT Solver Competitions](http://www.satcompetition.org/). During my studies, I was also a visiting researcher at the [Combinatorial Optimization Group](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/astra) hosted by [Prof. Pierre Flener](http://user.it.uu.se/~pierref/). I was the founder of [Sport Czar@Brown](http://cs.brown.edu/degrees/misc/jobs/jobs.html#sport) and the captain of ByteSoccer, the departmentâ€™s soccer team with intramural championships. I continue to serve the Brown community as an alumni interviewer for undergraduate admissions.  

### @Sabanci

I received my B.Sc. in CS from [Sabanci](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) and was awarded the [Sakip Sabanci Merit Scholarship](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/scholarship-opportunities-offered-during-education-period). I also studied as an Erasmus exchange student at [Uppsala](https://www.it.uu.se/research/computing_science). I continue to serve the Sabanci community as an external committee member. 

### @Soccer

Outside of work, I am an avid soccer fan; playing, watching and [coaching youth soccer](https://www.sportsmanager.us/readingyouthsoccer.htm). In a parallel universe, I hope to be the professor of assists.
