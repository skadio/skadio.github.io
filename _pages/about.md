Hi! I'm Serdar, Group VP of Artificial Intelligence in the AI Center of Excellence at **Fidelity Investments** and an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science at **Brown University**. Previously, I led the Advanced Constraint Technology R&D group at **Oracle** and worked at **Adobe**.

I specialize in driving **enterprise-scale AI strategy and transformation** through AI-native leadership. Leading cutting-edge research and delivering **production-ready AI solutions** with measurable business impact. Proven success in **building and scaling global AI teams** across technical and financial domains.

* [Year in Review](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serdark/recent-activity/articles) articles highlighting the evolution of this work.

My [algorithmic research](https://skadio.github.io/publications/) is at the intersection of AI and Optimization, while my [practical interests](https://skadio.github.io/software/) are in building robust, scalable, data-driven products that solve business-critical problems. 

Alongside my industry role, I actively [contribute](https://skadio.github.io/service/) to the AI research community as a senior programme committee for AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, ICLR, NeurIPS, and similar research organizations. I serve as **Co-Chair** of the Innovative Applications of AI Conference, **Co-Organizer** of LLMs meet Constraint Solving and Open-Source AI at AAAI, and **Lead Guest Editor** for the AI Magazine. [Teaching](https://skadio.github.io/teaching/) and learning from students are integral to my work.

## @Fidelity

Architect of **Enterprise AI** platforms and products, powering:  
* Recommender systems
* Agentic workflows (voice & text)
* Content generation and marketing optimization
* Document intelligence
* Lead generation and call routing
* Co-pilot experiences

Advocate of **Responsible AI**, model governance, and cross-functional collaboration. Recognized thought leader and frequent keynote speaker on Applied AI. Committed to **open-source innovation**, executive education, talent development, and strategic partnerships across industry, academia and public sector, including **Amazon, NVIDIA, Harvard, CMU**, and others.

<!--
Our applied science group focuses on Generative AI for Content, Recommender Systems for Personalization, Marketing Campaign Optimization for Lead Generation, and Responsible AI. We are involved from ideation to productionization across i) digital channels for external users over the web, mobile, email, and conversational agents, and ii) live channels for internal associates over the regional centers and branches. 

Overview of our applied research can be found in 

Internally, I guide the research agenda of the AI Center, serve as a liaison between data science, engineering and business teams and scale efforts on model governance, interpretability, fairness, and bias mitigation across the enterprise.

Externally, I coordinate strategic partnerships with the high-tech industry, including [Amazon](https://fcatalyst.com/blog/june2023/explainable-ai-using-expressive-boolean-formulas), Google, Weights & Biases, and [NVIDIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v-B2nRy79w), and research institutions including [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2023/may/fidelity-ai.html), Harvard, and MIT. I lead Fidelity's efforts in open source AI software, help organize college recruiting programs and mentor students, especially those from underrepresented groups through internships and co-op opportunities.

## @Oracle

<!--
[Supply Chain & Logistics](https://www.oracle.com/scm/), [Planning](https://www.oracle.com/erp/) & [Scheduling](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/), [Cloud Management](https://www.oracle.com/java/coherence/), and [Product Configuration](https://www.oracle.com/cx/). 
-->

Led the Advanced Constraint Technology R&D team to deploy state-of-the-art optimization solutions for Oracle products facing industry-scale problems in Supply Chain & Logistics, Planning & Scheduling, Cloud Resource Management, and Product Configuration.

Our contributions at Oracle were recognized with an **Entrepreneurship Award**, received funding for CMU-Oracle joint research grant, and covered in the media by [Business Insider as Oracle Rockstars](https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-rock-star-engineers-2016-3?op=0#serdar-kadioglu-turning-theory-into-products-21).


## @Adobe

<!--

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing
-->
Developed a context-free grammar-based evolutionary algorithm to generate automated test cases for the ActionScript virtual machine. This AI-based tester uncovered three critical software vulnerabilities, fixed before any global exploit.


## @Brown

-->

Earned a Ph.D. in CS from Brown working with [Prof. Meinolf Sellmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meinolf_Sellmann). My [doctorate thesis](http://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/phd/2012/kadioglu.pdf) explored deterministic inference methods for constraint satisfaction, search protocols for constrained optimization, and stochastic local search. During my studies, I also had the chance to work at the Optimization Group in Sweden as a visiting researcher hosted by [Prof. Pierre Flener](http://user.it.uu.se/~pierref/).

My research work was awarded the IBM PhD Scholarship, and I was a recipient of the Paris Kanellakis Fellowship In addition, our group at Brown designed automated algorithm configurators that won several gold medals in the International SAT Solver Competitions.

I founded the [Sport Czar@Brown](http://cs.brown.edu/degrees/misc/jobs/jobs.html#sport) and was the captain of ByteSoccer, the department's soccer team with back-to-back intramural championships. I continue to serve the Brown community as an alumni interviewer for undergraduate university admissions. 


## @Sabanci

Graduated with a B.Sc. in CS from [Sabanci](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) with the generous support of the [Sakip Sabanci Merit Scholarship](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/scholarship-opportunities-offered-during-education-period). Studied abroad at [Uppsala](https://www.it.uu.se/research/computing_science), Sweden as an Erasmus exchange student. Actively engaged as an external committee member and through [Crossing Paths](https://www.kesisenyollar.org/), a non-profit reducing inequality of opportunity in education. 


## @Soccer

Outside of work, I am an avid soccer fan; playing, watching, and [coaching youth soccer](https://www.sportsmanager.us/readingyouthsoccer.htm). In a parallel universe, I'd be the Professor of Assists.
